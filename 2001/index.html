	<b>W</b>elcome to the Virtual Haunted House. This house was constructed as an art project by fifth grade students.
	They dare you to explore its dark rooms and dusty corridors. Can you make it out alive?

	To navigate through the rooms, you may click the <i>Next Room</i> link at the top of each page.
	If you get too frightened, you may click the <i>Home</i> button to return to this screen.
	Do you have the courage to venture through the whole house?
