	<strong>A</strong>s you are rescued from the attic via a ladder provided by our tour guides, you tell them of the horrors inside and swear you'll never return.
	</p>
	<p class="intro">
	But you'll be back. You'll be back next year. For the ghosts never rest, and they so rarely get visitors.
	In the meantime, however, may they ask you one more favour? Won't you sign their guestbook? Until next Halloween...
