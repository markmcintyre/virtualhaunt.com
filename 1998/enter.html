There are stories about that old house...<BR>
Obscured by time, these stories became legend.<BR>
They say the house is haunted.<BR>

<U>Danielle's Tale:</U>

Witches, Goblins and Vampires
Strolling through the night
Scaring everybody that was in their sight
The moon was full and bright
The scaring kept on going
All through the night
Everybody would hide
Because they were terrified
Then the witches, Goblins and
Vampires went in for the night

<U>Natalie's Tale:</U>

It's a quiet place...
A spooky place
Nobody would ever set foot in there
Except a girl named Danielle
We waited and waited for her to come out
But she never ever did come out
Her parents went to look for her
And never found her
So me and my friends went in
And got Danielle and others out

</PRE>

Are these tales true? There is only one way to find out...<BR>
Are you up to it?<BR><BR>
